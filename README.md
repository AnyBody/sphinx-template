# AnyBody Sphinx template

<!-- start sphinx snippet -->

This template is used to easily create sphinx pages using Markdown. It uses the [sphinx book theme](https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/), but can be easily changed:

Pages are written in [MyST Markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which makes it easy write basic
pages, while maintaining the full power of sphinx.
